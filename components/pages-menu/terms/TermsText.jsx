          14.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of either Party to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by such party in writing. In the event of any litigation of any controversy or dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, its interpretation, its performance, or the like, the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, court costs, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses attributable to the prosecution or defense of that controversy or dispute.

          14.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracer Hire reserves the right to alter the terms of this Agreement at any time. If the alterations constitute a “material change” to the Agreement, Tracer Hire will notify Customer. What constitutes a “material change” will be determined at Tracer Hire’s sole discretion, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgment, but will only include those changes that materially affect Customer’s use of the Hosted Services or rights under this Agreement. Notice will be considered to have been delivered once sent.  Customer agrees to review the latest version of the Agreement on Tracer Hire’s website periodically to remain aware of any non-material modifications to the Agreement about which Customer is not alerted by Tracer Hire.  The Agreement available on the website will be dated so as to make clear what version is currently in force.  Any use of the Hosted Services after alteration of the Agreement will constitute acceptance by Customer of such changes. Customer’s sole remedy should Customer not agree with the altered Agreement shall be to cease Customer’s use of the Hosted Services and to comply with Customer’s termination obligations outlined in Section 11 of this Agreement.
